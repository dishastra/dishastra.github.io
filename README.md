# Dishastra
### One-stop solution to your navigation problems

This is the repository for Dishastra, our navigation solution for inconsistent GPS Feeds. 

Only the frontend of the website in the form of a landing page has been uploaded to this repo; the backend has been setup locally.

**React** has been used to develop the frontend interface.

To view the frontend locally, clone this repo, navigate to `/src` and and run `npm start`. Note that NodeJS must be installed on your system.
